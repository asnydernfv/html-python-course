You can use if, or if/else statements to perform logic if it meets a condition like true or false.
Any logic that runs because of the statement needs to be indented.

Example:
animals = ["cat", "dog", "fish", "iguana", "deer"]

if "cat" in animals:
    print("Cat is in the list!")
if "dog" in animals:
    print("Dog is in the list!")
print("You do not have to have and else statement!")


if "cat" in animals:
    print("Cat is in the list!")
else:
    print("Cat is not in the list!")
