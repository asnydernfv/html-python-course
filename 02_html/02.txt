What makes html, html?

.html file extension, boiler plate code from 01_html

All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.

HTML Elements
An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and an end tag, with the content inserted in between:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<p>My first paragraph.</p>

HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag, such as the <br> element (which indicates a line break).

HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.

The HTML5 standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.

Let's add out first element, a header.

<h1>Hello World</h1>

Next let's add a paragraph.

<p>My first paragraph</p>

Now Let's add a line break in between.
<br>
