In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Data can be stored in variables.

Text Type:	str
    Letters, numbers, symbols. Inside of single or double quotes.
    x = "Hello World"
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
    numbers, not in quotes
    x = 20
    x = 20.5
    x = 1j
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
    List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
        In square brackets []
        x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
        In parenthesis ()
        x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
    Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
        In curly brackets without Keys, only values {}
        x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
        x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})
    Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.
        In curly brackets with key value pairs {}
        x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}	
    x = range(6)
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
    Not Common in Python3
Boolean Type:
    True/False
    x = True
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
    Not common in Python3
    x = b"Hello"
    x = bytearray(5)
    x = memoryview(bytes(5))
