We will start by covering HTML which stands for HyperText Markup Language.

It is NOT a Programming Language. It simply tells your browser how to display
items in your browser, similar to Microsoft Word or Google Docs.

Later on we'll start adding in CSS to start making our content look nice,
and then we'll add in some more advanced features with some JavaScript. JavaScript
is a programming language that can run natively in your browser.
