You can also do math in python with the operators below

Operator	Name	        Example
+	        Addition	    x + y	
-	        Subtraction	    x - y	
*	        Multiplication	x * y	
/	        Division	    x / y	
%	        Modulus	        x % y	
**	        Exponentiation	x ** y	
//	        Floor division	x // y

Modulus returns the remainder value after division.
    14%3 = 12/3 with Remainder of 2. Would return 2.
    10%2 = 10/2 No remainder. Would return 0.
Floor Divides two numbers, and if the result is a float, it rounds down to the nearest integer.
    10//4 = 2 because 10/4 = 2.5
    10//6 = 1 because 10/6 = 1.67
